h1. STUMPy

_Mutaku URL Shortener_


h3. WHAT IS STUMPY?

STUMPy is a URL shortener written by xiao_haozi (Mutaku) using the django python web framework.


h3. WHY STUMPY?

There are man url shorteners out there, and STUMPy does not do anything groundbreaking.
However, there are several benefits that encouraged it's development:
* you keep all the data and can access it at your will
* you keep all the code and can access/change it at your will
* simple to use, simple to run, and simple code
* because of it's simplicity, it is easy to understand how url shorteners work and some of the possible optimizations
* uses the django framework which allows for easy expansion, management, and tweaking
* django also allows for a nice web UI for administration of all of the data

* "Python":http://www.python.org/getit/
* "Django":http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/intro/install/
* "HTML5lib":http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/
* "Bleach":https://github.com/jsocol/bleach


h3. INSTALLATION,SETUP, AND TESTING:

See: "Django Install":http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/intro/install/
Once you have django installed and running, you can checkout the repo and get going in three steps:
# Setup a mysql database that stumpy can access.
	__create database stumpy;
	grant all on stumpy.* to 'SOMEUSER@localhost' identified by "SOMEPASS";
	flush privilieges;__
# Copy the local_settings.py.dist file to local_settings.py .
	__cp local_settings.py.dist local_settings.py__
# If you do not have a SECRET_KEY generated in Django you will need to generate one by running the keygen script and copy that key into your local_settings.py file in the next step. 
	__python gimme_key.py__
# Edit the local_settings.py file and add in your appropriate database variables and your secret key generated above in step 3.
# Sync the database to the models.
	__python manage.py syncdb__
# Fire up the server and navigate to /admin in your browser. Go to sites->sites and edit the domain name to match the domain you are using. This will initially be set to 'example.com'.
	__python manage.py runserver__

See: "Deploying Django":http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/howto/deployment/


h3. USAGE:

You will probably be able to see from the urls.py how to go about using Stumpy. Here's the rundown:
* [site]/ 		->	index view (recent stumps, popular stumps, and the bookmarklet)
* [site]/[shorturl] 	->	grab shorturl and redirect
* [site]/register		->	register new user [for users - admin can add through admin interface]
* [site]/admin 		*->	admin interface 
* [site]/url/[longurl] 	*->	shorten url [this is how the bookmarklet does it] [needs to be escaped if not using bookmarklet]

*-> These views require authenticated_user and uses sessions


h3. NOTES:

A bookmarklet is ready to use and can be found by visiting the index page ("/") and dragging the 'stumpy it!' link to your bookmarks bar.

To add additional users that may submit URLs, add the user via the admin interface. They do not need to have any admin interface abilities to simply login and and submit URLs.
If you want a user to have permission to edit and delete urls (why?) you would have to enable those permissions in the user management in the admin interface.
