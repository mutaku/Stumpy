STUMPy
  Mutaku URL Shortener

[BEING CONVERTED TO USE DJANGO]


WHAT IS STUMPY?
STUMPy is a URL shortener written by xiao_haozi (Mutaku) using the django python web framework.


WHY STUMPY?
There are man url shorteners out there, and STUMPy does not do anything groundbreaking.
However, there are several benefits that encouraged it's development:
  - you keep all the data and can access it at your will
  - you keep all the code and can access/change it at your will
  - simple to use, simple to run, and simple code
  - because of it's simplicity, it is easy to understand how url shorteners work and some of the possible optimizations
  - uses the django framework which allows for easy expansion, management, and tweaking
  - django also allows for a nice web UI for administration of all of the data
