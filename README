STUMPy
  Mutaku URL Shortener



WHAT IS STUMPY?
STUMPy is a URL shortener written by xiao_haozi (Mutaku) using the django python web framework.


WHY STUMPY?
There are man url shorteners out there, and STUMPy does not do anything groundbreaking.
However, there are several benefits that encouraged it's development:
  - you keep all the data and can access it at your will
  - you keep all the code and can access/change it at your will
  - simple to use, simple to run, and simple code
  - because of it's simplicity, it is easy to understand how url shorteners work and some of the possible optimizations
  - uses the django framework which allows for easy expansion, management, and tweaking
  - django also allows for a nice web UI for administration of all of the data


REQUIREMENTS:

{requirement [package way to install]}

- Python [sudo apt-get install python]
- Django [see: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/intro/install/]
- HTML5LIB [sudo apt-get install python-setuptools && sudo python easy_install html5lib]
- Bleach **this is already included cloned in the Stumpy repository so no installation necessary


INSTALLATION AND TESTING:
See: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/intro/install/
Once you have django installed and running, you can checkout the repo and get going in three steps:
  1 - Setup a mysql database that stumpy can access.
	> create database stumpy;
	> grant all on stumpy.* to SOMEUSER@localhost identified by "SOMEPASS";
	> flush privilieges;
  2 - Edit the settings.py file and add in your appropriate database variables and then sync the database to the models [python manage.py syncdb].
  3 - Fire up the server [python manage.py runserver] and navigate to /admin in your browser. Go to sites->sites and edit the domain name to match the domain you are using. This will initially be set to 'example.com'.
